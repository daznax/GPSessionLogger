GlobalPoker (GP) is a "Sweepstakes Coin" (SC) Poker website that is availble to the United States. This allows folks outside of Vegas to play online poker.
The site has some disadvantages compared to regulated sites that are available in other parts of the world (i.e. Pokerstars), the main of which being that it is difficult to track statistics (a valuable tool in poker),

This project aims to address these issues by providing a [manual] way for a player to track session stats by using buttons.
Following a session, the data will be saved into a spreadsheet and can be referenced or maniopulated using Excel tools.
